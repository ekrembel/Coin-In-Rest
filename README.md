# CoinInRest - The Virtual Stock Market

CoinInRest is a virtual stock market. Everything about the shares on this market are real and up-to-date except the money. 
Users use virtual money to buy shares and get the same type of money when they sell them. 
Because the transactions and the money are not real, the users have nothing to earn or lose in real world.
This application is essentially meant for users that are interested in the stock market but do not know much about it, or do not have any experience in the market.

## Possible Improvements

- The email addresses of the users are confirmed by default. A confirmation email can be sent to users to confirm their emails addresses.
- When users attempt to reset their passwords, it sends the email address and the token to the reset password page. A reset password email can be sent to users to authenticate them. 
- The check out functionality only adds the amount to the users' fund, and even if the users enter their correct payment information, no fee can be charged from their card right now. This could be completed to carry out the full transaction.
